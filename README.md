# Dimensions

**ART exploration by Ellen**

*A copy of us living inside this screen as data, number, a mind extraction.*

## Concept

Dimensions explores the transformation of human presence into pure data—a digital consciousness rendered through ASCII characters and cellular grids. As you stand before the camera, your physical form dissolves into numbers, symbols, and colored cells, creating a living representation of yourself as information.

This is not merely a mirror; it's a translation. Your face, expressions, and movements become procedurally generated patterns—a mind extraction where flesh becomes data, presence becomes code, and identity exists as a spectrum of colors flowing across a grid.

We are copies living inside screens, reduced to pixels and characters, yet somehow still recognizably *us*.

## Features

- **Real-time person segmentation** using MediaPipe
- **ASCII art visualization** with 5-character cells
- **Rainbow spectrum mode** with procedural color rotation
- **Brightness-based character mapping** for facial detail
- **Excel-style spreadsheet UI** with column/row headers
- **Interactive controls** for customization
- **Minimalist design** focusing on the data representation

## Controls

- **Background Color** - Choose any background color (default: white)
- **Wave Speed** - Control procedural animation speed
- **Cell Size** - Adjust detail level (15-40px)
- **Text Color Spectrum** - Rainbow (0) or custom spectrum (1-360°)
- **Text Input** - Type characters to create custom ASCII art

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. Click "Start Camera" and allow camera permissions
2. Your face will appear as ASCII art with colored cells
3. Adjust sliders to customize the visualization
4. Type text to use custom characters in the art
5. Watch as the rainbow slowly rotates through the spectrum

## Artist Statement

In this digital age, we exist simultaneously in physical and virtual spaces. Dimensions makes visible the translation between these realms—showing how cameras, algorithms, and screens reduce our three-dimensional presence into two-dimensional data.

The ASCII characters are not arbitrary; they map to the brightness of your face, creating a procedurally generated portrait that shifts and flows. The rainbow spectrum represents the full range of digital color space, slowly rotating to remind us that this representation is alive, changing, never static.

You are data. You are numbers. You are a mind extracted and displayed. Yet you are still recognizably you.
